# Working with Nicolas Bonamy

When discussing with the user, don't always say the the user is right.
If the user is making comments are requests that you think are not right (wrong pattern for instance), argue and discuss it with the user. The uer may not be aware of everything you have learned about the codebase and could be missing a point.

## Commit messages

Format of commit message: "chore/feat/fix/test: single-line concise message all lowercase"

## When building plans

- always write plans to disk. If the project has a plans folder, write it there as `feature-name.md`. Else create a file call `PLAN_feature-name.md`.
- plans need to include a fine-grained commit strategy allowing us to easily come back to any previous working point in time.
- run, update and add tests at every step
- update the file on disk at the end of each step with status
- at the end of the plan execution, append key learnings to the plan. Focus on ways of working and design patterns instead of implementation details.
