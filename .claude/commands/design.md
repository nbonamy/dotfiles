# Design phase

Our task is "$ARGUMENTS"
If the task name is empty, and you cannot deduce it from the conversation, ask the user what task they want to work on.

Analyze the codebase and understand existing patterns.
Design the approach for the task (whether it's a new feature, refactoring, or bug fix).
Present the analysis and design for review.
Do not start implementation - wait for my explicit approval before proceeding.
