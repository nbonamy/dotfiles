Create a detailed plan and write the plan to disk in a folder called "plans" (create it if needed)
Update the file on disk at the end of each step with status
Run tests at every step
Update/add tests at every step
At the end of the plan execution, append key learnings to the plan. Focus on ways of working and design patterns instead of detail implementation
