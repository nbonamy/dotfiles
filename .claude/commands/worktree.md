We need to work on this task in a dedicated worktree.

Once the worktree is created you need to:
- run "npm ci" do install dependencies
- copy .env file for configuration

You will work in small increments commiting frequently.
You will NOT automatically merge the worktree back at the end: you need to wait for final user approval.
Once green light is given, you will squash all commits into one.
