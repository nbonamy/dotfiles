# Fix ALL the tests

We need 100% passing.
Even if you don't think you broke one test, don't stop until 100% passing.

When failures are detected you should decide if the test is broken because of:

- implementation has changed, test needs to be updated
- side effect of a recent change, regression is detected

In doubt, always clarify with the user.

NEVER update implementation without confirming with the user first.
